# ForceMeter GUI
The dir `ender_fdm`, `force_gauge.py`, `results2csv.py`, `combined_tests.py` and `defined_models.csv` is forked from https://github.com/fetlab/printer_force_displacement!

## How to run
To run the GUI, run: 
  - Windows: `python GUI_main.py`
  - Linux/Mac: `python3 GUI_main.py` 

## Tips while running
- Do keep a the console open while running, it is nice to have while preforming tests.

## Architecture
### Overview: 
Tkinter-based desktop GUI that orchestrates mechanical tests in a background process, streams readings back via queues, and plots Force–Displacement in real time with Matplotlib. All code related to executing the force-displacement tests are keept in `ender_fdm` and its main file `force_test.py`. Inside the dirs `configs`, `test_reports`, `custom_tests` and `plots` are saved configuration files, JSON test reports, custom test recipes and saved plots respectively.

### Classes
Each class from the dir `GUI_classes` are initilized inside the GUI_main.py. The GUI_main.py holds most of the state information.

#### Auxiliary.py
Holds AUX function that does not take self, most importanly `safe_call()` that calls the main function of the force testing logic within force_test.py.

#### Communication.py
Keeps track of the two one directinal Queues used for commnication between the GUI and back-end testing logic. 
*msg_queue*: the GUI reads from this 
*cmd_queue*: the backend read from this, currently only inside the custom test function in ender_fdm/force_gauge.py.

### PlotPanel.py
Embeds a Matplotlib figure and periodically updates the Force–Displacement plot using data buffered in `Communication.tests`. Supports reset and saving plots.

### TopRowPanel.py
Controls ports and movement: display/setup ports, set move size, manual Z up/down, emergency stop (terminates the process), reset plot, save plot, change ports.

### PastConfigPanel.py
Lists previously saved configuration files; provides refresh, delete (single/all), and double-click to load a config and set it as `active_config`.

### CustomTestBuilder.py
Sends stepwise custom commands to the running test via `cmd_queue`; supports undo last move,     finish/save a `custom_test_recipe`, and upload/playback recipes for a selected config. Weeh uploading/rerunning a custom test the config used for the test, needs to be present in the dir `GUI_classes/configs`.

### TestReportPanel.py
Lists JSON test reports, supports invalidate (marks a JSON report unuseable) and delete; 

### DataJson.py
Defines the data models:
- **TestConfig**: Dataclass of test parameters (serial ports, motion settings, test options);     JSON-serializable.
- **custom_test_recipe**: Dataclass representing a named sequence of custom moves; JSON-          serializable.

### custom_msg.py
Defines message types used in custom testing:
- **custom_test_msg**: A single move instruction with `direction` and `z_inc`.
- **panic_msg**: An undo signal carrying the step to revert.

## Testing logic
Inside the `force_gauge.py` is the config from the GUI read and the test function according to the `Test_type` is executed and all parameters need for the test can be found in the config file.
Inside the `ender_fdm/force_gauge.py` is the main logic of each test type implemented. 

# Parameters of the config file
### Serial Connection Parameters

| `force_gauge_baud` | Baud rate of the force gauge serial connection. |
| `printer_port` | Serial port used to communicate with the 3D printer. |
| `printer_baud` | Baud rate of the printer serial connection. |
---

### Motion Options
| Parameter | Description |
|----------|------------|
| `feedrate` | Default feedrate for all printer movements (mm/min). |
---

### Startup Move Options
| Parameter | Description |
|----------|------------|
| `first_move_z_up_by` | Move the Z-axis up by this distance (mm) before starting. |
| `first_move_z_down_by` | Move the Z-axis down by this distance (mm) before starting. |
| `exit_after_first_z_move` | Exit the program after performing the initial Z movement. |
